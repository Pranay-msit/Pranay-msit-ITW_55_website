                <div> Charles Reeves, whose first name means "cool breeze over the mountains" in Hawaiian, was born
                    September 2,
                    1964 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is the son of Patricia Taylor, a showgirl and costume designer, and
                    Samuel
                    Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. Keanu's father was born in Hawaii, of British, Portuguese, Native
                    Hawaiian,
                    and
                    Chinese ancestry, and Keanu's mother is originally from England. After his parents' marriage
                    dissolved,
                    Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister, Kim Reeves, to New York City, then Toronto.

                    was Paul Aaron, a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she
                    went
                    on
                    to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller and hair salon owner Jack Bond. Reeves never
                    reconnected
                    with his biological father. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen
                    interest in
                    ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname "The Wall") and drama. He eventually dropped out
                    of
                    school to pursue an acting career.</div>
